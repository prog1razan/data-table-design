## Background & Objectives

The goal of this challenge is to create your first table using the [SQL Designer](http://db.lewagon.com).

## Specs

### Designing your first table

Let's create a table to store users. Each user has:

- A first name
- A last name
- An age
- And an email

What is the type of each column? Remember, all of your tables will also have an `id` column!

### Drawing the table

Use the [SQL Designer](http://db.lewagon.com) to draw the users table with the columns specified above.

### Saving and checking your solution
To save your work in the SQL Designer online, hit the F2 button on your keyboard. Depending on your keyboard configuration, you might have to hit the Function (Fn) key + the F2 key together.

To check your solution, you first have to save your work to your computer:
1. click on "Save / Load",
2. then click on "Save XML",
3. and finally copy/paste the generated XML code into `users.xml`.

You can then `make` to check your solution.

## Key learning points

- Become comfortable with using the [SQL Designer](http://db.lewagon.com) tool to build a table.
- Use the correct naming conventions for table and column names
- Ask yourself about the type of each column
